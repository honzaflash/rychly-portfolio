# (My) Portfolio Website

A place to show what I am about professionally.

# Used Tech
### React
I chose to use React just to show case what I already know and have experience with. That should also speed up the process for me as I want an up-to-date protfolio quickly since I am currently searching for a job.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Material UI
I have use MUI before and liked the flexibility in designing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### `yarn deploy`
Builds and pushes the app to a deployment branch via `gh-pages`.

### `yarn lint`
Runs `eslint` on the project.

### `yarn lint:fix`
Runs `eslint --fix` on the project.

### `yarn gen` or `yarn generate:configs`
Runs a script that converts all yaml files in `src/configs/` to json files (creating new files).

### `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `yarn run eject`
Standard create-react-app eject.
**Note: this is a one-way operation.**
